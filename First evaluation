I finally succeeded in installing the app! Here are my preliminary comments. I know the developing team had done a marvelous and wonderful job, so my comments below should be taken with a giant grain of salt!

Overall downloading and installation (on PC):
The process was not straightforward due to multiplicity of files that had to be downloaded / installed. Also, the fan of my computer ran very rapidly and noisily several times during the installation process. Maybe I need to upgrade my graphics card! I wonder about the HoloLens handling of the files.

Scenes/Views/SunView:
Very beautiful. However, the sun was very far and I was unable to zoom in on it! Totally missed this experience :(

Scenes/Views/MercuryView:
Very beautiful and elegant. Smaller shadow might be better.

Scenes/Views/VenusView:
Same as above.

Scenes/Views/EarthView:
Excellent realistic animation of earth and moon! However, the animation showed spots on Earth when I zoomed out. No such spots on the moon, though. Using up/down arrows is counter-intuitive: pressing up moves the animation down and vice-versa! Mouse did not allow easy manipulation.

Scenes/Views/MarsView:
Marvelous  animation. However, important geologic structures (e.g. Olympus Mons, polar caps and Equatorial canyon) need to show more prominently. Same for Marsâ€™ moons.

Scenes/Views/JupiterView:
Awesome animation and sounds. Are those real sounds or artistic? Also, at least the Galilean moons need to show! Finally, having smaller shadow would be more attractive.

Scenes/Views/SaturnView:
Very nicely pictured although adding some moons and movement would be better.

Scenes/Views/UranusView:
Nicely done although adding some moons / smaller shadow would be better.

Scenes/Views/NeptuneView:
Nicely done although adding some moons would be better.

Scenes/Views/PlutoView:
Very nicely textured although adding the moons would be better.

Scenes/Views/SolarSystemView:
Very beautiful, especially respect of orbital velocity. However, number of asteroid belt objects needs to be increased / size reduced / blurred.

Scenes/Views/GalaxyView:
Beautiful! However, more detail might be needed. Diffraction spikes show on some stars but not all https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike#/media/File:NGC6397.jpg  There are (i) arrows and circles pointing to orbits. Finally, shape of galaxy / color and shapes of stars / nebulae / clusters / constellation outlines might be needed.

Excellent work!
